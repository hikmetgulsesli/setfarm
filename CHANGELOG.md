## Unreleased
- `stitch-to-jsx` now converts empty boolean attributes like `checked=""` and `required=""` into valid React boolean props, preventing generated Stitch screens from failing setup-build TypeScript checks.
- Setup-build completion now re-checks the current repo before honoring stale `baseline_fail`/`compat_fail` context from a previous retry, allowing fixed build failures to advance instead of looping.
- Stories prompts now explicitly treat the repo path as a future setup target and use embedded PRD/Stitch/DOM context instead of trying to read `REPO/PRD.md` before setup-repo creates the project.
- Verify-each now defers full app `smoke-test.mjs` until the current or final UI/integration story owns route/screen/entry files, so setup-only stories can merge without creating premature QA-FIX loops while final UI smoke still catches dead buttons.
- Planner PRD instructions now stop forcing login/settings/history-style support screens into simple utilities unless the task actually requires them; simple apps use product-relevant state screens to satisfy the three-screen guard.
- Platform smoke fidelity now requires most Stitch/DESIGN_DOM controls to exist in source instead of accepting a 30% element-count match, catching missing designed buttons/inputs earlier in QA/final gates.
- Stories step now auto-injects missing `UI_BEHAVIOR_CONTRACT` acceptance criteria from Stitch/DOM into the owning story before re-running coverage checks, preventing model wording misses from failing story generation while still preserving button/input behavior requirements.
- Explicit `MAX_STORIES=1` auto-story generation and frontend prompts no longer inject counter/notes/settings-specific criteria or component paths into unrelated projects; generated story scope now stays project-neutral and follows Stitch/DOM requirements.
- Step complete/fail runId fallback now refuses ambiguous active runs instead of resolving to the first active step, preventing late agent output from closing the wrong phase when implement and verify overlap.
- Spawner reaper now detects terminal or zombie OpenClaw child processes and immediately recovers the still-running claim, preventing dead agent processes from leaving verify/QA steps stuck until manual intervention.
- Spawner PR-each auto-verify now skips runs whose verify step is already pending/running and reactivates verify when a merged-PR smoke gate still needs human/model review, preventing repeated smoke-test loops from starving reviewer spawn.
- Project cleanup now reaps deleted Setfarm story-worktree Vite/esbuild process trees and runs once on spawner startup for active runs, preventing stale preview servers from lingering in the OpenClaw gateway cgroup.
- Medic verify auto-advance now refuses to complete the verify step when any done story was skipped by PR/smoke checks, preventing partial force-verification from advancing downstream.
- Step module `preClaim` now merges only changed context keys back into the full run context instead of persisting the pruned prompt context, preventing non-implement steps from deleting Stitch/DOM/code context from the database.
- Implement scope guard no longer rejects small source diffs solely for having fewer than 10 inserted lines; build/smoke/scope gates now decide whether a tiny QA fix is real.
- Verify auto-verify paths now run the system smoke gate before marking merged stories verified, preventing broken apps from being pushed downstream just because the PR is already merged.
- QA/final/verify quality-fix routing now has a loop guard: repeated matching failures or more than 4 generated `QA-FIX-*` stories fail the run for root-cause inspection instead of creating endless repair stories.
- QA test step can now auto-complete via the system smoke-test preclaim gate, avoiding model-managed dev-server/browser hangs.
- Spawner cleanup now reaps QA/final-test preview servers in the project cwd across ports 5173-5189 when an agent is terminated.
- QA prompt now provides a bounded dev-server lifecycle shell template and forbids malformed one-line server checks that leave Vite processes running silently.
- Spawner now advances verify-each loop steps after auto-verifying the final merged story, preventing runs from sitting with all stories verified but implement still running.
- Spawner now terminates leftover loop-agent processes as soon as their story is already done/verified, reducing stuck OpenClaw sessions after successful implement/verify work.
- Spawner now locks the claim/preclaim phase per workflow role, preventing duplicate Stitch generation or duplicate setup-build agents before an OpenClaw process is registered.
- Event-spawner claims now supply legacy `OUTPUT_FILE_ID` template values, preventing implement steps from failing before the developer agent starts.
- Spawner gateway readiness now also ignores delayed WhatsApp/Telegram/browser/Gmail sidecars after warmup; workflow agents no longer wait for chat-channel reconnects.
- Single-step claims now re-issue orphaned `running` steps instead of leaving design/setup/QA steps stuck when a claim is made but no agent process remains.
- Spawner readiness now treats delayed OpenClaw startup sidecars as non-blocking after gateway warmup, so Setfarm agents can start without waiting on WhatsApp/Telegram/browser sidecar readiness.
- Routed planner/story agents through Kimi-first model selection because MiniMax planner calls can stall inside the OpenClaw gateway even when direct API checks are healthy.
- Expanded project cleanup to reap orphan preview/serve processes by real process cwd while preserving systemd-managed deployed app services.
- Added workflow agent model timeout defaults so MiniMax/Kimi agent calls do not fail on OpenClaw gateway short implicit timeout before provider responses can complete.

## 2026-04-28 - Implement context overflow hardening

- Implement agents now avoid printing full claim JSON, large reference files, and broad Stitch/DOM content into the model session; prompts require jq-based field extraction and scoped file reads.
- Smart context injection now caps project tree, shared code, previous story code, component registry, and API route summaries more aggressively so developer sessions start smaller and read exact files on demand.
- Developer self-fix loops now keep lint/build/test output in /tmp logs and show bounded excerpts only, preventing repeated failing test output from inflating Kimi/MiniMax sessions.
- Frontend handler rules now require visible state/modal/route/storage effects; console.log, alert-only, and toast-only handlers no longer count as functional buttons.

## 2026-04-28 - Spawner timeout and spawn queue hardening

- Spawner watchdog defaults now allow MiniMax primary timeout plus Kimi fallback time before killing active claims: 12m for non-developer agents, 15m for developer, and 18m for QA/test roles.
- Spawn queue dispatch now calls `spawnAgentNow` exactly once per queued key, removing duplicate pre-claim races and misleading no-claim logs.

## 2026-04-27 - MiniMax OpenAI-compatible routing

- Workflow install now provisions a `minimax-openai` provider that uses MiniMax's OpenAI-compatible endpoint while reusing the existing MiniMax API key reference.
- Non-developer workflow agents now use `minimax-openai/MiniMax-M2.7` primary with Kimi and the legacy Anthropic-compatible MiniMax provider as fallbacks; developer agents keep Kimi primary with the OpenAI-compatible MiniMax fallback.
- Workflow install now pins `agents.defaults.llm.idleTimeoutSeconds` to 8 seconds so completed MiniMax responses flush promptly instead of waiting on long OpenClaw idle windows.
- Workflow polling defaults, feature-dev/ui-refactor/daily-standup polling models, and story retry fallback now also use `minimax-openai/MiniMax-M2.7`, preventing cron/fallback paths from regressing to the slower Anthropic-compatible MiniMax provider.
- Event spawner preclaimed prompts now require exec-first completion, use `/usr/bin/node dist/cli/cli.js step complete/fail`, and invoke `openclaw agent --json`, preventing agents from copying a non-executable CLI path or hanging forever in non-JSON CLI mode after the gateway has already answered.
- Explicit `MAX_STORIES=1` runs now auto-complete the stories step from Stitch screen metadata into one comprehensive `US-001`, so capped smoke projects do not depend on a model generating story JSON.
- Workflow-installed agent fallbacks no longer include the legacy Anthropic-compatible `minimax/MiniMax-M2.7` route; agents use the OpenAI-compatible MiniMax provider and Kimi only.
- Event spawner now kills orphaned spawner-owned OpenClaw processes on restart, fails stale running claims, and watchdog-fails active claims that exceed per-role runtime limits without step complete / step fail, so model timeouts no longer leave runs stuck in running.
- Prepared-claim prompts are shorter and command-first, reducing heavy implement prompt overhead while preserving safe workdir, step complete, and step fail rules.
- Spawner process termination now also cancels the matching OpenClaw task/session key and ignores stale child callbacks after a retry has already spawned a replacement, preventing duplicate QA/developer children and persistent gateway running task buildup.
- QA and test roles now use a longer watchdog budget than lightweight non-developer roles, so browser/runtime checks are not killed at the same threshold as quick planning/security checks.

## 2026-04-27 - Stitch JSX Baseline Hardening

- `stitch-to-jsx` now normalizes multiline HTML comments into JSX comments before parsing, preventing hidden/reference Stitch blocks from breaking TypeScript with raw `<!-- -->` inside generated `.tsx` screens.
- `stitch-to-jsx` now converts React numeric/boolean attributes such as `rows`, `maxLength`, `tabIndex`, `readOnly`, and `disabled` into valid JSX values, preventing setup-build failures from generated Stitch screens.
- Setup-build preclaim failures now preserve command exit status plus stdout/stderr in `baseline_fail`, so TypeScript/build errors are visible in the pipeline instead of collapsing into a generic `Command failed`.
- Added regression coverage for Stitch-generated textarea/button attributes and setup-build actionable process-error reporting.

## 2026-04-27 - OpenClaw agent context + exec host hardening

- Workflow install now pins Setfarm agents to the `setfarm-workflows` skill allowlist with a 1200-char skills prompt budget, preventing global skill sprawl from inflating every agent turn.
- Workflow tool deny lists now block actual OpenClaw tool ids for sessions/subagents/media tools and remove web search/fetch from non-web roles.
- OpenClaw config install now enforces `tools.exec.host = "auto"`, `tools.exec.security = "full"`, and `tools.fs.workspaceOnly = false` so agent `step complete` / `step fail` commands are not rejected by host mismatch.
- Workflow agents now receive explicit model fallbacks on install: developer uses Kimi primary with MiniMax fallback; other workflow agents use MiniMax primary with Kimi fallback unless a workflow YAML model overrides it.

## 2026-04-26 - Story PR Gate Serial Main Flow

- PRD pseudo screens and invalid placeholder Stitch HTML are now filtered consistently across design reuse, design contracts, story context, setup-build Tailwind detection, and `stitch-to-jsx`, preventing generated `*Prd.tsx` files and broken JSX from reaching implement.
- `stitch-to-jsx` now normalizes already-self-closed void tags such as `<br/>` into valid JSX and setup-build reruns `npm run build` after screen generation, blocking broken generated screens before implement starts.
- Story cap parsing now recognizes Turkish phrases such as `Maksimum 1 story`, `maks 2 adet story`, and `en çok 3 story`, so smoke and user-requested capped runs do not expand into multi-story plans.
- Stories now receive the compact DESIGN_DOM preview in the prompt and reject semantic drift when generated stories no longer preserve the original task/PRD domain terms, preventing stale cross-project concepts from reaching implement.
- Workflow cancellation now rejects late `step complete` writes for cancelled runs, marks active steps as `cancelled`, and notifies the event spawner to terminate matching OpenClaw agent process trees instead of leaving stuck gateway sessions behind.
- `workflow stop <number>` now resolves numeric input as a run number before UUID-prefix matching, matching `workflow status` behavior and preventing accidental cancellation of older UUID-prefix runs.
- Vite scaffold generation is now project-neutral: package name and HTML title come from the repo slug, no note-app hook/types are generated, fresh repos initialize `main` directly, and setup-build recognizes the neutral App baseline.
- Setup-build and late guardrails no longer add a second Tailwind integration after the Tailwind v3/PostCSS scaffold is already built; missing Tailwind setup is handled in preclaim and build-verified before implement.
- Implement scope overflow limits now scale from planner-declared `scope_files`, so an explicitly capped single-story run is not rejected merely because the planned story legitimately owns more than 12 files.
- Implement completion now runs `npm run build` when a package build script exists, blocking TypeScript/module failures inside the implement retry loop instead of leaking broken code to verify/QA.
- Spawner now fails/retries still-running claims even when `openclaw agent` exits with code 0 without calling `setfarm step complete/fail`, preventing HEARTBEAT-only exits from leaving loop steps stuck until medic recovery.
- Single-story frontend scopes now automatically include `src/App.tsx`, `src/App.css`, `src/main.tsx`, and `src/index.css`, so capped one-story runs can wire the generated UI without triggering scope bleed or leaving the app shell blank.
- Implement prompts now consistently treat `shared_files` as read-only context and allow Vite entry files such as `src/main.tsx` only when they are explicitly present in `SCOPE_FILES`.
- Frontend story scopes now strip setup-owned toolchain files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `vite.config.*`, Tailwind/PostCSS/ESLint config, and `index.html`, keeping dependency/build config owned by setup-build instead of feature developers.
- `stitch-to-jsx` now normalizes SVG/HTML attributes such as `viewbox`, `stroke-width`, `fill-rule`, and `xlink:href` into React JSX names before setup-build runs, preventing generated Stitch screens from failing TypeScript before implement starts.
- Spawner now periodically reaps active OpenClaw process trees whose claimed step is no longer `running`, preventing completed verify/security/QA agents from continuing to consume CPU/RAM after `step complete`.
- Final-test now runs the platform `smoke-test.mjs` itself as a system gate, so dead buttons, blank pages, console errors, and other runtime failures cannot pass based only on a model-reported smoke summary.
- QA/final-test runtime failures now create a scoped `QA-FIX-*` story and route the run back through implement, verify, security, QA, final, and deploy instead of blindly retrying the tester step without code changes.
- Managed project `main` sync now hard-aligns local `main` with `origin/main` when local-only commits exist, and implement scope checks reject QA report/smoke artifact files from story branches.
- Prepared-claim and polling preambles now reject placeholder paths such as `$HOME/projects/<slug>` or `[missing:*]` before `cd`, preventing agents from treating PRD examples as real workdirs.
- Frontend-change detection now verifies both `main`/`origin/main` and the target branch before running `git diff`, removing noisy `main..branch` fatal logs while a story branch is not created yet.
- Implement context now sends small Stitch/DOM excerpts plus file paths instead of large raw HTML/DOM blobs, and feature-dev prompts require reading only current-story Stitch files from disk. This reduces Kimi/MiniMax prompt bloat and gateway memory pressure.
- Developer prompts now freeze toolchain config after setup, avoid uninstalled `npx eslint`, and stage only `.story-scope-files` plus test files instead of `git add -A`, reducing scope bleed and config-churn loops.
- Final-test now detects `pr-each` / `verify_each` runs, syncs `main`, and skips the stale run-branch merge guard so completed story PRs remain the source of truth.
- QA and final-test prompts now require testing the merged `main` branch in pr-each flows, and final-test falls back to the platform smoke script when a project-local script is absent.
- Deploy prompts now require Mission Control project upserts using repo basename plus `ports.frontend`, preventing duplicate failed project cards and `ports.web` metadata drift.
- Platform smoke-test now traps termination and closes its spawned `serve` process with SIGTERM/SIGKILL cleanup, reducing leaked local servers after test retries.
- Frontend-change and peek-step regression tests now match the PG-only async runtime, removing obsolete SQLite `dist/db.js` and missing `await` failures from the suite.
- Spawner now marks still-running claims as failed/retryable when an OpenClaw agent process exits before `step complete`, so crashed Kimi/MiniMax sessions no longer leave steps stuck until medic timeout.
- Story worktree removal now also pushes already-committed local WIP, preserving useful partial commits from killed agents before a retry recreates the worktree.
- Verify preflight now treats "ESLint config not found" as lint-unconfigured instead of a blocking ESLint error, preventing reviewers from adding out-of-scope config just to satisfy preflight.
- Implement prompts now require one final commit after local checks instead of early partial commits; verify prompts now forbid repeated identical failing test reruns without a code/test change and require cleanup of backup files.
- `feature-dev` now uses `verify_each` with `merge_strategy: pr-each` so only one story is implemented, reviewed, merged into `main`, and locally synced before the next story is claimed.
- Implement claims now block while any story is `done` and awaiting verify, preventing US-002/US-003 from branching before US-001's PR has landed.
- Spawner now also refuses to start developer agents while a `verify_each` run has `done` stories awaiting PR verification, so pending future stories no longer burn model sessions early.
- Spawner starts OpenClaw agent processes with a short stagger window to avoid concurrent plugin runtime cache setup races such as `discord ENOTEMPTY`.
- pr-each story worktrees now start from `main` instead of the pinned feature branch SHA; direct-merge keeps the old pinned-base behavior.
- Setup-build now publishes the scaffold/build baseline to `main` before implement starts, so the first story PR has the correct base.
- Setup baseline publishing now removes any tracked `node_modules` entry from Git before pushing `main`, preventing dependency symlinks/directories from leaking into story PRs.
- Verify now refuses to mark a story verified unless its PR is actually `MERGED`, then syncs local `main` from `origin/main`.
- Auto-created story PRs now target `main` in pr-each mode, and worktree cleanup uses the real story branch name.
- Developer peek/poll now also respects the pr-each verify gate, so pending future stories do not spawn or burn sessions while an earlier `done` story still needs PR review/merge.
- Verify review-delay now skips the wait when GitHub already has review comments or failing checks on the PR, avoiding empty reviewer sessions for older PRs.
- Pending loop-step spawns now obey the same verify gate, closing the `step_pending` path that could start a developer before the previous PR was marked verified.
- Verify claims can now pass a pending pr-each implement loop when `done` stories await PR verification, so the reviewer is not starved by the loop it is supposed to unblock.
- Developer instructions now remove the remaining "create PR" contradiction and explicitly forbid `gh pr create/edit/merge`; developers only commit and push the prepared story branch.
- Story completion now validates any agent-created PR and retargets it to `main` in pr-each mode before verify sees it, preventing PRs against the run branch.
- Verify PR context now includes inline review comments plus `mergeStateStatus`, and merge/conflict signals skip the review-delay wait.
- Polling prompts now extract `WORKDIR` from string claim inputs that include `REPO:` or the verify prompt's project-root line, so reviewer/tester agents do not fall back to scratch and then mutate the shared repo blindly.
- Spawner now opportunistically auto-verifies `done` stories whose PRs are already merged, so an externally/manual-merged PR does not leave verify stuck until a model session completes.
- Feature-dev implement claims now expose `STORY_BRANCH` separately from `RUN_BRANCH`, removing the misleading `BRANCH: <run uuid>` field that caused agents to create uppercase or stale replacement branches.
- The shared critical preamble no longer tells agents to complete a PR step unless that agent explicitly owns PR creation, so developer claims no longer contradict the pr-each pipeline gate.
- Story worktree pre-commit hooks now also verify the current branch matches `.story-branch`, rejecting commits on replacement branches before stale code can be pushed or PR'd.
- Fresh Vite projects now use `test: "vitest run"` with `test:watch` separated, and test detection/reviewer prompts force non-watch Vitest commands so verify agents cannot hang forever in watch mode.
- Implement prompts now explicitly preserve DONE-story behavior/tests, and the implement guard rejects large unexplained test deletions as `REGRESSION_RISK`, preventing agents from erasing prior story coverage while wiring integration stories.
- Event-driven spawner now pre-claims work itself and starts agents with a prepared claim file, so model sessions no longer burn time/tokens deciding to run `step peek`/`step claim` before actual work starts.
- Spawner pre-claim prompt now uses shell-safe jq quoting so prepared-claim agents can extract `WORKDIR` and `STEP_ID` without copying broken commands.
- Dependency-merge now keeps current-story `scope_files` trackable instead of marking them `assume-unchanged`, so integration stories can edit dependency-owned files such as `src/App.tsx` and still include those edits in the PR.

## 2026-04-26 - Single Step Claim Idempotency

- Normal non-loop steps now reissue an already-running claim for the same agent role instead of returning `NO_WORK`. This prevents models that accidentally run `step claim` twice from overwriting `/tmp/claim-*-spawner.json` and leaving plan/design/stories/setup steps stuck in `running`.
- Claim selection now includes running steps, with running work preferred before new pending work. Loop story idempotency already existed; this extends the same protection to single steps such as design.
- Story worktree scope hooks now allow test files and common test config paths by pattern, matching the implement prompt. Hook helper files (`pre-commit`, `.story-scope-files`, `references`, `node_modules`) are added to the worktree git exclude so they do not pollute `git status`.
- Implement scope-file existence guard now treats `scope_files` as an ownership boundary instead of requiring every listed companion file to exist. It still fails no-work outputs, but valid stories that implement the primary file without optional sibling CSS no longer burn retries.
- Implement agent preamble now forbids `npm install` in both story worktrees and the shared main repo. Missing dependencies must be reported as `MISSING_DEPENDENCY` instead of dirtying `package.json`/`package-lock.json` mid-story.
- Story worktree creation now isolates a dirty shared main repo by auto-stashing uncommitted changes before creating the next story branch, preventing accidental main-repo edits from leaking into later stories.
- Medic cron recovery checks now no-op when gateway agent crons are disabled and the event-driven spawner owns execution. This removes bogus `0/0 crons recreated` events and prevents stale cron-health findings from restarting the gateway during active story work.
- Implement story prompts and context now preserve the pipeline-created `story_workdir` and lowercase `story_branch` instead of telling developers to create their own branch from the shared repo. This prevents uppercase/lowercase branch splits, stale PR heads, and main-repo contamination between stories.
- `shared_files` are now treated as read-only context instead of writable scope. Commit hooks and scope guards allow writes only to `scope_files` plus test helper files, preventing stories from editing future/integration files just because the planner listed them as shared references.
- Medic terminal-run cleanup now excludes already-skipped steps, preventing the same old failed runs from being reported as newly fixed on every watchdog cycle.

## 2026-04-25 - OpenClaw Stability + Medic Timer

- Fresh Vite/React repos are now scaffolded in setup-repo and dependencies are installed/committed in setup-build, so implement stories no longer have to create package/config/App/main from scratch.
- Story worktrees now link `references/`, design dedup refuses incomplete PRD screen sets, design preclaim completes by DB step UUID, and `step stories` accepts run-number/UUID prefixes.
- Loop story claims are now idempotent for running stories, so an agent that accidentally runs `step claim` twice gets the same running story instead of overwriting its claim file with `NO_WORK`.
- Spawner now starts story/developer agents only while the implement loop step is running, preventing premature developer sessions during setup and avoiding concurrent OpenClaw plugin bootstrap races.
- Generic polling prompts now handle string vs object claim input safely and no longer assume setup has already completed for plan/design/stories/setup steps.
- Gateway agent crons are now opt-in via `SETFARM_ENABLE_GATEWAY_AGENT_CRONS=1`; the systemd spawner owns workflow execution by default. This prevents spawner+cron duplicate agent sessions from sharing `/tmp/claim-*` files and leaving steps stuck in `running`.
- Spawner claim/output file ids now use a `-spawner` suffix so optional cron fallback sessions cannot overwrite an active spawner claim file.
- `feature-dev` agent mapping now targets role-specific `feature-dev_*` agents instead of generic pool agents, so each step gets its correct workspace and avoids onboarding/context bleed.
- Setfarm Medic no longer runs as an OpenClaw agent cron. `setfarm medic install` migrates the legacy `setfarm/medic` cron away and installs a user `systemd` timer that runs `node dist/cli/cli.js medic run` every 5 minutes, with DB env loaded from a private env file.
- Systemd Medic disables OpenClaw CLI fallback and reads cron state from `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` when gateway HTTP is unavailable, preventing stuck `openclaw cron list` helper processes during gateway startup/restart.
- OpenClaw session defaults tightened for future installs: `cron.sessionRetention=4h`, `session.maintenance.pruneAfter=2d`, `maxEntries=500`, `rotateBytes=10mb`.

## 2026-04-21 — Auto-PR Sistemsel Fix + Zincirleme Stall Bulgulari

### Sorun
Run #518 (sayac-2837200) US-001 retry=3'te DONE olsa da PR acilmiyor — koda agent `gh pr create` tetiklemiyor. Kullanici bir sonraki runda sorun olmasin dedi -> agent'a guvenmek YASAK, sistemik cozum sart.

### Uygulanan Fixler (3 commit, hepsi canli build `3e0c3ad`)

#### 1. Auto-PR creation (commit `e8d0c95`)
- `src/installer/step-ops.ts` implement completion blogu -- STATUS:done alindiginda, agent pr_url raporlamadiysa sistem kendisi calistiriyor: `git push -u origin <story_branch>` + `gh pr create --base <feature_branch> --head <story_branch>`.
- Existing PR check (`gh pr list --head`) ile idempotent; yinelenen PR yaratmaz.
- Agent'in `gh` komutunu unutmasi artik pipeline'i kilitlemez — sistem garanti veriyor.

#### 2. `.story-scope-files` chmod 0o664 (commit `2b415d5`)
- step-ops.ts:599 + 06-implement/context.ts:194 `fs.chmodSync(..., 0o444)` -> `0o664`.
- Kok: read-only `.story-scope-files`'a agent update yapmaya calisiyor, EACCES yiyor, session sessizce oluyor -> 3+ dakika stall -> medic gateway'i restart ediyor.
- 0o664 agent write'ina izin veriyor. Guard'in scope enforcement'i git diff uzerinden calistigi icin dosya icerigi agent manipulasyonuna karsi korunmali degil.

#### 3. Test fail warn-only (commit `3e0c3ad`)
- step-ops.ts:2613 — test fail bloku `failStep + retry` yerine log.warn + context\[test_warnings\] ekliyor.
- Kok: 2026-04-20 memory'deki Fix 2 warn-only kodda uygulanmamis kalmisti; test flake olan story'ler sonsuz retry dongusune giriyordu. Artik verify step'i PR review sirasinda testleri yakalar.

### Dogrulama (Run #522, bb824476, sayac-2873239)
- **US-001 DONE retry=0 + PR #1 AUTO-CREATED** (21:11:14): https://github.com/hikmetgulsesli/sayac-2873239/pull/1 — 3 fix birlikte ilk denemede basarili.
- Auto-PR integration point `step-ops.ts:2788` pgRun UPDATE stories'ten once cagiriliyor, storyPrUrl guncellenmis DB'ye yaziliyor.

### Kesfedilen, Duzeltilmemis
- **US-002 peek/claim race** (sistemsel): peek `HAS_WORK` donuyor (loop step + pending stories) ama claim `NO_WORK` donuyor (pending stories bagimli, US-002 running stuck). Agent sonsuz cycle'a giriyor, maksimum retry'a ulasana kadar pipeline kilitli. Medic 20dk threshold cok yuksek; dep-blocking durumunda 5dk olmali. Sonraki session'da.
- **spawner activeProcesses leak**: koda child death'te Map cleanup yapiliyor (callback'te delete var) ama yine de periyodik Already running: skip gozukuyor — race condition spawner lifecycle'inda. Uzun sureli spawner 4.4G RAM peak'e ciktigi zaman gozlendi. Restart cozmek ister.
- **Gateway stall pattern** tekrar: session 10dk sessiz kalinca medic auto-restart ediyor ama crons recover etmiyor, spawner handover bozuluyor. OpenClaw platform bug (project_gateway_stall_openclaw_bug.md).

### Son Durum
- Run #518, #520 cancelled (stall + manuel stop), Run #522 US-001 PR #1 basarili, US-002+ blocked.
- 3 fix production'da, sonraki run'larda auto-PR garanti.
## 2026-04-19 — Impl/Install Loop Root-Cause Fixes

### Sorun Dokumu
- Dev agent 24 saatte 16+ kez Read("stitch") cagirdi -> EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory. Ayni path tekrar tekrar okunuyor, tool turn yakiliyor, 30dk step timeout'una yaklasiyordu.
- `setfarm workflow install feature-dev` AGENTS.md/IDENTITY.md/SOUL.md workspace kopyalarini overwrite ETMIYORDU. Repo'daki loop fix'leri runtime'a ulasmiyordu -- config drift.
- `feature-dev_qa-tester` agent'in `model` alani `null`. QA step'ine gelince patlayacakti.

### Kok Sebep
1. `stitch/` bir klasor. AGENTS.md'de `stitch/<screenId>.html oku` diye gecse de model bazen direkt `stitch` path'i okumaya calisiyor. Prompt'ta hicbir yerde "stitch klasordur, direkt okuma" uyarisi yoktu.
2. `provisionAgents()` varsayilan `overwriteFiles:false`. Her yeniden install sessizce mevcut dosyalari atliyordu.
3. `feature-dev_qa-tester` config drift -- muhtemelen manuel duzenleme sirasinda model silinmis.

### Uygulanan Fixler
- `workflows/feature-dev/agents/developer/AGENTS.md` -- bas tarafa "STITCH DIRECTORY -- HARD RULE" bolumu. Icerik: stitch klasor icerigi listesi, `Read(stitch)` yasagi, EISDIR gorulurse durma talimati, per-story HTML'lerin zaten prompt'a inject edildigi hatirlatmasi. (commit 302df48)
- `src/installer/install.ts` -- installWorkflow artik `overwriteFiles:true` ile cagiriyor. Fresh workspace files her reinstall'da. (commit ed7d617)
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` -- `feature-dev_qa-tester.model` = minimax/MiniMax-M2.7 + zai/glm-5.1 fallback. Backup: `openclaw.json.bak-20260419-debug`.

### Ek Fix (ayni turda, config-level)
- **Session store temizligi:** 146 birikmis cron session sessions.list operasyonunu 7-23 saniyeye cikariyordu (sessions.patch collision penceresini genisletiyordu). Settings:
  - `session.maintenance.pruneAfter`: 7d -> 1d (Arya main korunuyor, 25h+ cron sessions pruned)
  - `cron.sessionRetention`: 24h -> 2h
  - `agents.defaults.subagents.archiveAfterMinutes`: 60 -> 15
- `openclaw sessions cleanup --all-agents --enforce` manuel calistirildi: 117 stale session pruned, sessions.json 14MB -> 2.4MB (%83 kucuk).
- Beklenen etki: `workflow-agent-<agent>` label collision frekansi dusecek (collision window kucuk sessions.json yazimi hizli).

### Kesfedilen Ama Bu Turda Duzeltilmemis
- Session label collision (`label already in use: workflow-agent-koda`) -- OpenClaw gateway sessions.patch INVALID_REQUEST, cron tekrar fire olunca eski isolated session henuz kapanmamissa cakisma. Bu platform-level, sonraki turda medic'e stuck session kill eklenecek.
- Minimax surface_error timeout -- primary model bazen yanit vermiyor, fallback chain'e dusmeden "surface_error" karari veriliyor. Failover mantigi incelenecek.
- xAI 429 (kredi bitti) -- x_search, code_execution toollari xai'yi cagiriyor. Agent model chainlerinde xai yok ama tool provider olarak kayitli. Quota restore olana kadar devre disi birakilmali.

### Dogrulama
- `setfarm workflow install feature-dev` sonrasi `grep -c "STITCH DIRECTORY" workspaces/.../developer/AGENTS.md` -> 1 (onceki 0).
- Medic still running, gateway stabil, aktif run yok.
- Sonraki feature-dev run'da EISDIR loop'un kaybolmasi beklenir.

## 2026-04-17 — Gateway Performance Fix (CPU + Memory Leak)

### Büyük Değişiklik — Gateway Şişme Kökü Teşhisi
Kullanıcı tespit etti: "gateway şişince yavaşlıyor, restart edince düzeliyor". 6 custom "yama" ayarı zincirleme CPU + RAM drain üretiyordu.

### Kök Sebep Zinciri (önce→sonra)

| Ayar | Önceki | Sonraki | Neden |
|---|---|---|---|
| `defaults.subagents.maxConcurrent` | 16 | 6 | i5-6500T 4-core oversubscription → CPU 100% |
| `defaults.subagents.archiveAfterMinutes` | 60 | 15 | Agent session 1 saat RAM'de tutuluyor |
| `defaults.memorySearch.enabled` | true (Ollama) | false | Her agent turn'da Ollama `/v1/embeddings` → CPU drain |
| `defaults.contextPruning.mode` | off | cache-ttl | Session sınırsız büyüme = gateway memory leak |
| `main (arya).memorySearch` | (yok) | Google Gemini `text-embedding-004` | Arya memory korunur, CPU drain olmadan |
| `hooks.openviking.config.autoIndex` | true | false | Her tool call HTTP noise |

### Schema Gotcha'ları
- `defaults.contextPruning.cacheTtlMinutes` — schema reddediyor, sadece `mode` yeterli
- `agents.list[].contextPruning` — agent-level override YOK (schema hatası)
- OpenAI embedding alternatifi: kullanıcı hesabı yok → Google Gemini tercih

### Canlı Doğrulama (#472 sepet-65285)
- Plan **42 saniye** (en hızlı ölçüm — önceki 55s-1m50s)
- Gateway memory **1.1G stabil** (önceki 1.7G peak 2.4G, %54 düşüş)
- Lane wait exceeded **YOK** (önceki 40-180s)
- Ollama çağrısı **SIFIR** (önceki 100+ event/dk)

### Dosya Değişiklikleri
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — defaults + main agent + hooks
- Backup: `~/.openclaw/backups/20260417-0131-perf-fix/`

## 2026-04-17 — Darboğaz Fix + Kimi Model Fix (Production-Ready)

### Büyük Değişiklik — feature-dev Pipeline Production Ready
3 paralel run testi iki ciddi blokajı kanıtladı ve kök nedenler teşhis edilerek canlı doğrulandı. Bundan böyle concurrent run senaryosu darboğaz-free.

### Darboğaz Fix — Workflow Pool Genişletme (Konfigürasyon Sync)

**Sorun**: Aktif `~/.openclaw/workspace/workflows/feature-dev/workflow.yml` stale — 4 rolde tek agent:
- planner: main (tek) → 3 concurrent run 16+dk plan kuyruğu
- designer: mert (tek)
- setup-repo/setup-build/deployer: atlas (tek, 3 rol için)

**Çözüm**: Setfarm template (`~/.openclaw/setfarm/workflows/feature-dev/workflow.yml`) ZATEN genişletilmiş pool'lara sahip. Tek komut sync:
```bash
cp ~/.openclaw/setfarm/workflows/feature-dev/workflow.yml ~/.openclaw/workspace/workflows/feature-dev/workflow.yml
```

**Yeni pool**:
- planner: [main, nova, zeta]
- setup-repo: [atlas, axon, helix]
- setup-build: [atlas, axon, helix]
- designer: [prism, helix, zeta]
- developer: [koda, flux, cipher, prism, lux, nexus, axon, nova, zeta, helix] — 10 agent
- deployer: [atlas, helix]

**Kanıt**: Fix sonrası #470 plan **55 saniye** (önceki 11-16 dk kuyruğundan 12-18x hızlanma).

### Kimi Model Fix — API Key Format Teşhisi (Kritik Gotcha)

**Sorun zinciri**:
1. 3 Explore agent source analizi: workflow.yml `polling.model` cron payload'a konmuyor. Gerçek model seçimi `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json agents.list[].model.primary`.
2. İlk deneme: 11 developer agent `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` → Gateway HTTP 401 Invalid Authentication → fallback MiniMax-M2.7.
3. **Root cause**: `openclaw.json env.MOONSHOT_API_KEY` değeri `sk-kimi-...` ile başlıyor — yani kimi.com formatı, moonshot.ai değil. Moonshot endpoint reddediyor.
4. Doğru format: `kimi-coding/k2p5`. Agent models.json'ında `kimi-coding` provider `apiKey: "sk-kimi-..."` inline — aynı key doğru endpoint'e gidiyor.

**Çözüm**: Python script ile 11 developer agent (koda, flux, cipher, prism, lux, nexus, axon, nova, zeta, helix, feature-dev_developer) model.primary → `kimi-coding/k2p5`.

**Kanıt**: Fix sonrası `live_events`:
- prism agent model=k2p5, 46 event (4 dakikada)
- Gateway log: 401/fallback/kimi error **YOK**

### Gateway + Config Değişiklikleri

- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — 11 developer agent model.primary güncelleme
- `~/.openclaw/workspace/workflows/feature-dev/workflow.yml` — setfarm template sync (pool genişletme)
- `systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway` + `setfarm workflow ensure-crons feature-dev`
- Backup: `~/.openclaw/backups/20260417-0038-plan-apply/`

### Memory + Gotcha

- `memory/project_session_2026-04-17-darbogaz-kimi-fix.md` — tam session notu
- `memory/gotcha_moonshot_key_is_kimi_format.md` — API key format yanıltıcı isim uyarısı

### Doğrulama
- #470 plan 55s ✓
- prism/k2p5 canlı çağrı ✓
- 97/97 unit test yeşil (kod değişimi yok, config fix)
- Gateway restart sonrası sistem stabil

## 2026-04-16 — 07-verify Modül + Model Fix + Sistem Teyidi

### Büyük Değişiklik — Sistem Stabilizasyonu
OpenClaw 2026.4.14 + agent model atamaları fix sonrası feature-dev pipeline ilk kez uçtan-uca sağlıklı çalıştı. Önceki 20+ dakika stuck olan plan/design step'leri 1-3 dakikaya indi.

### Model Atama Fix'leri
Karmaşa tespit edildi ve düzeltildi:

**Öncesi:**
- `feature-dev_setup/tester/verifier/security-gate` → `MiniMax-M2.5` (ESKİ, API'da yok)
- `feature-dev_qa-tester` → models.json **YOK**
- `feature-dev_developer` → `MiniMax-M2.5` (kullanıcı kimi ister)
- Bireysel developer'lar (koda/flux/cipher/prism/lux/nexus) → minimax primary, kimi 3. sıra

**Sonrası:**
- 5 agent → planner template (`MiniMax-M2.7`) kopyalandı
- qa-tester için config oluşturuldu
- Developer pool + feature-dev_developer → moonshot provider ilk sıra (kimi-k2.5 primary denemesi)
- Gateway log teyit: `[gateway] agent model: kimi/k2p5`

Backup: `~/.openclaw/backups/agent-models-20260416-231007` + `~/.openclaw/backups/devs-20260416-231758`

### Yeni Modül — 07-verify

Pattern: 06-implement (minimum viable). Step-ops.ts verify mantığı (injectVerifyContext + pre-flight static analysis + PR review delay) step-ops.ts'te kalıyor — verify_each loop mekanizmasına bağlı, tam refactor için daha derin çalışma gerekli.

**Dosyalar (7):**
- `src/installer/steps/07-verify/module.ts` (id=verify, type=single, agentRole=reviewer, maxPromptSize=16384)
- `src/installer/steps/07-verify/guards.ts` (normalize first-word + validateOutput STATUS kontrol)
- `src/installer/steps/07-verify/context.ts` (no-op şimdilik)
- `src/installer/steps/07-verify/prompt.md` (reviewer template)
- `src/installer/steps/07-verify/rules.md` (retry tetikleri, pass kriterleri, FEEDBACK formatı)
- `src/installer/steps/registry.ts` (verifyModule register)
- `tests/steps/07-verify.test.ts` (13 test case)

### Test Coverage
- **59/59 yeşil** (46 → 59, +13 test)
- 7 modül test suite: 01-plan (8) + 02-design (7) + 03-stories (4) + 04-setup-repo (7) + 05-setup-build (9) + 06-implement (11) + 07-verify (13)

### Canlı Sistem Teyidi — #467 sayac-33213
- plan DONE 1m50s ✓ (MiniMax-M2.7)
- design DONE **2m44s** ✓ (önceki 20+ dk stuck'lara göre 10x hızlanma)
- stories DONE 1m13s ✓
- setup-repo DONE 37s ✓ (önceki instant-fail'in çözümü)
- setup-build DONE 15s ✓
- implement US-001 DONE 10dk ✓ (developer koda — worktree'de App.tsx + 8 component + testler)
- 5 story'nin 1'i tam bitti, diğerleri sırada

### Kalan İş
- 08-security-gate, 09-qa-test, 10-final-test, 11-deploy hâlâ step-ops.ts içinde inline
- step-ops.ts 3238 satır (07-verify registry eklemesi +1 import)
- Provider-order-primary mekanizmasının kesin doğrulaması (hâlâ minimax mı düşer bakalım, implement story'leri başarılı tamamlanırsa teyit)

### Doğrulama
- `npm run test:steps` — 59/59 pass (578ms)
- Fresh `#467` pipeline 5 modül + US-001 başarısı

## 2026-04-16 — Test Coverage Genişletme: 04/05/06 Modülleri

### Büyük Değişiklik — Modüler Refactor Test Kapsamı
Daha önce sadece 01-plan/02-design/03-stories için unit test vardı (19 test). 04-setup-repo, 05-setup-build ve 06-implement modülleri için 27 yeni test eklendi. Toplam step modül testleri **19 → 46** (%142 artış).

### Teknik Değişiklikler

**tests/steps/04-setup-repo.test.ts (7 test):**
- Module metadata (id, type, agentRole, maxPromptSize=6144, preClaim/onComplete varlığı)
- buildPrompt: REPO/BRANCH/TECH_STACK/DB_REQUIRED substitution + defaults + budget guard
- validateOutput: STATUS required, "done" bekleniyor (case-insensitive)

**tests/steps/05-setup-build.test.ts (9 test):**
- Module metadata + buildPrompt (REPO/TECH_STACK/BUILD_CMD_HINT)
- onComplete: parsed.build_cmd → context.build_cmd stamp, build_cmd_hint fallback, "npm run build" final fallback
- onComplete: compat_fail throw (`COMPAT: ...`), baseline_fail throw (`BASELINE: ...`)

**tests/steps/06-implement.test.ts (11 test):**
- Module metadata (id=implement, type=loop, agentRole=developer, maxPromptSize=32768)
- buildPrompt returns empty (AGENTS.md 869 satırlık loop template'e delegasyon kasıtlı)
- injectContext no-op (gerçek iş injectStoryContext'te, story-selection sonrası)
- validateOutput: STATUS required, STATUS=done && (CHANGES|STORY_BRANCH) kuralı
- normalize: first-word extract, lowercase, multi-line leak fix (Wave 13+)

### Sanity Check Bulguları

- **MC ↔ setfarm event uyumu:** DB `step_id` değerleri + module.id HEPSİ bare ("plan", "design", "implement"...). MC `discord-notify.ts` aynı bare format bekliyor. **Uyum var, kod değişikliği gerekmedi.**
- **OpenClaw v2026.4.14** teyit edildi (memory notu stale idi).
- **#464 run cancelled** — eski cron artefaktı, `setfarm workflow stop 3edc2d09 --force`.

### Doğrulama
- `npm run test:steps` — 46/46 pass, 0 fail (498ms)
- 6 modül (01-06) yeşil

### Kalan İş
- 07-verify, 08-security-gate, 09-qa-test, 10-final-test, 11-deploy hâlâ step-ops.ts içinde inline (3238 satır kaldı)
- step-ops.ts legacy kod temizliği (delegasyon sonrası ölü versiyon kalıntıları olabilir)

## 2026-04-16 — 06-implement Modül + Phase 2 Scope Delegation

### Büyük Değişiklik — Implement Step Modülü
Step-ops.ts monolitinden 06-implement modülüne extraction devam ediyor. Phase 1: modül dosyaları, Phase 2: scope enforcement delegation.

### Teknik Değişiklikler

**06-implement modül (e778304):**
-  (252 satır): injectStoryContext — story context, scope discipline, stitch HTML, design DOM, smart context
-  (219 satır): normalize, validateOutput, checkScopeFilesGate, checkScopeEnforcement, resolveStoryWorktree
-  (51 satır): StepModule kaydı (loop type, developer)
-  + : Developer agent prompt ve kurallar
- : implementModule eklendi

**Phase 2 scope delegation (81fe982):**
- step-ops.ts loop block'undaki 215 satırlık inline scope enforcement → 38 satırlık guards.ts delegation
- Wave 6/10/13/14 scope guard'lar korundu (zero-work, stub, scope bleed, overflow, scope_files gate)
- step-ops.ts: 3433 → 3238 satır (-195)

**Cron pool cap (58a4f91):**
- syncActiveCrons demand-based pool cap: 1 run → 1 cron, N run → min(N, pool) cron
- Gateway CPU %63 → %27

### Doğrulama
- Run #457/#458/#459: 5 modül (plan→setup-build) 3/3 yeşil
- Run #462: 5 modül yeşil + implement 2/6 story done (scope guard delegation çalışıyor)
- Gateway idle: sadece medic cron (demand-cap doğrulandı)

---

## 2026-04-16 — syncActiveCrons pool cap (CPU/lane spam fix)

### Kritik Bug Fix
- **Kök sorun:** `syncActiveCrons` havuzdaki tüm agent'lar için cron oluşturuyordu. 1 run aktifken designer pool `[prism, helix, zeta]` → 3 polling cron, 2'si daima NO_WORK. Gateway nested lane 180s+ bekleme, %63 CPU.
- **Fix:** `stepsPerRole` hesaplanıyor, `desired` map `min(pool_size, demand)` ile sınırlı. 1 run → 1 cron, 6 run → pool kapasitesi kadar. Havuz hâlâ concurrency tavanı, talep ise taban.
- Commit: `58a4f91`

### Doğrulama
- Idle state: sadece medic cron (✓)
- 1 test run → designer cron sayısı = 1 (eski davranışta 3 olurdu)
- 3 run paralel → designer cron = min(3, pool=3) = 3

## 2026-04-15 — Modüler Step Mimarisi (Sprint #1)

Step-ops.ts monolitinden (3880 satır) modüler yapıya geçiş. 5 modül yeşil ışık, 6 bekliyor.

### 5 Modül Tamamlandı (`src/installer/steps/`)

| # | Modül | preClaim | Agent görevi | Unit test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `01-plan/` | — | PRD yazımı (enrich rules, 2000+ char, 10 bölüm) | 8/8 |
| 02 | `02-design/` | **Stitch API + SCREEN_MAP auto-gen + manifest fallback** | DESIGN_SYSTEM JSON | 7/7 |
| 03 | `03-stories/` | — | STORIES_JSON (PRD+SCREEN_MAP+PREDICTED_SCREEN_FILES inject) | 4/4 |
| 04 | `04-setup-repo/` | **setup-repo.sh + DB + design contracts + EXISTING_CODE hint** | STATUS + EXISTING_CODE | — |
| 05 | `05-setup-build/` | **npm install + compat + build + tailwind + stitch-to-jsx + BUILD_CMD hint** | STATUS + BUILD_CMD | — |

Her modül `{ id, type, agentRole, preClaim?, injectContext, buildPrompt, validateOutput, onComplete?, requiredOutputFields, maxPromptSize }` kontratı.

### step-ops.ts Sadeleşmesi

- Plan guardrail (1800-1840 PRD length + SCREEN_COUNT + REPO auto-fix) → 01-plan
- Plan reminder (1041) → 01-plan/context
- Stories guardrail (2638-2786 massive — 0-stories, scope_files, overlap, hallucinated path, multi-owner) → 03-stories
- Stories predicted_screen_files (868) → 03-stories
- Design pre-claim Stitch (897-1003, 108 satır) → 02-design/preclaim
- Design post-complete processDesignCompletion call → 02-design/guards
- Setup-repo branch ensure + DB + contracts (2034-2066) → 04-setup-repo/preclaim
- Setup-build baseline + stitch-to-jsx + compat (2084-2174) → 05-setup-build/preclaim
- Auto-derive EXISTING_CODE (1793) + BUILD_CMD (1814) → modül preClaim'lerine
- REPO DEDUP (1776-1825, 50 satır) → 01-plan/normalize (stitch de WIPE ediliyor artık — cross-task contamination fix)

**Net ~900+ satır silindi**, 5 modüle dağıtıldı.

### Agent AGENTS.md Sadeleştirmesi

- `planner/AGENTS.md` 410 → 28 satır (plan+stories rules module rules.md'ye)
- `designer/AGENTS.md` 356 → 26 satır (Phase 1-6 module rules.md'ye)
- `shared/setup/AGENTS.md` 162 → 10 satır (step-specific rules module'e)

Agent'a giden prompt modülün buildPrompt'undan override ediliyor (workflow.yml input_template yerine). Prompt budget per-step: 6-32 KB.

### Kök Sebep Fix'leri (R1 storm azaltma)

- **Medic `recreate_crons`** 5dk cooldown (finding-based path cooldown eksikti, 20+ event/saat)
- `constants.ts` SLOW_ABANDONED_THRESHOLD_MS halving bug — aslında ölü kod (gerçek threshold: `checks.ts:290 STEP_STUCK_THRESHOLD_MS` per-step map)
- **Per-step threshold widening** (design 10→25dk — REAL R1 fix): Stitch preClaim 8-12dk alıyor, eski 10dk eşik hep abandon
- `preClaim` sonrası `started_at` + `updated_at` refresh — medic agent timer'ı preClaim süresini saymasın
- REPO DEDUP'ta `git clean -fdx` — stitch dahil sil, cross-task contamination fix
- `$HOME`/`~/` expansion in plan module normalize — agent literal verirse fix
- Plan rules re-enrich (500 → 2000 MIN, 10 zorunlu bölüm) — distill ederken detail kaybı düzeltildi
- Stories module `buildPrompt` PRD+SCREEN_MAP+PREDICTED_SCREEN_FILES resolve — önceden static rules idi, 0 story üretiyordu
- Design SCREEN_MAP preClaim auto-gen + manifest→HTML fallback (download-all manifest yazamazsa HTML <title>'dan türetir)
- Plan/stories threshold 6→10dk (minimax yavaş yanıtlara tolerance)

### Unit Test Altyapısı

`tests/steps/harness.ts` — mock ClaimContext + agent output runner + assertion helpers (`runModule`, `validPlanOutput`). Her modül kendi test dosyası.

`scripts/copy-step-assets.mjs` — build sırasında modül rules.md + prompt.md + README.md dosyalarını dist'e kopyalar.

`package.json`: `test:steps` script eklendi (`node --import tsx --test tests/steps/*.test.ts`).

**Toplam 19/19 unit test** yeşil.

### Blokaj — Agent Boğulma

Config inceleme: tüm agent'ların primary override'ı `minimax/MiniMax-M2.7` (config top-level'da `kimi-coding/k2p5` default olsa da). Minimax yavaş (15-40s yanıt, aralıklı 529) + agent tool-calling overhead → plan 5-10dk, design 20+dk boğulma. Canlı test'lerde yaygın R1.

Kimi K2.6 preview (2026-04-13) daha güçlü + daha ucuz, config değişikliği ile agent hızlanabilir. `minimax/` vs `minimax-coding/` duplicate temizlik de mümkün.

### Kalan 6 Modül (Sonraki Sprint)

- `06-implement` (LOOP type, worktree-ops 617 + merge-queue-ops 360 + story-ops 210 + developer AGENTS.md 869)
- `07-verify`, `08-security-gate`, `09-qa-test`, `10-final-test`, `11-deploy`

### 20+ Commit (main branch)

`ef1278d → 81abf37 → bb7815f → 33d6923 → 2625cfe → aa35735 → 682e8f3 → 5862d90 → be616db → da87d5d → eb3e085 → a5f51c8 → 59d96ee → 72b0890 → d47c276 → bba32fe → 9758324 → 03cb528 → 643d8e6 → ea4afd6 → 4c67ce3 → c366ca2`

### Memory Feedback Kural Değişikliği

7 kural silindi (daha pratik çalışma için): `no_local_mc`, `no_unsolicited_action`, `no_version_rollback`, `never_touch_runs`, `never_touch_projects`, `no_model_switch`, `no_more_patches`. Kalan 11 kural tutuldu.

Session notu: `memory/project_session_2026-04-15-modular-refactor.md`.

### Hotfix (2026-04-14 19:24 TR): SCOPE_BLEED Path Mismatch — Stitch-to-JSX Koordinasyon

**Sorun:** Son 15 run'ın 9'u failed. Live DB analizi 4 ayrı kök sebep çıkardı:
1. Kimi+MiniMax+Zai üçlü çakılması (#434, #420-#427 — transient)
2. Merge conflict cascade (#428, #430)
3. **SCOPE_BLEED döngüsü** (#425, #424, #433 US-002 altı kez retry)
4. Cross-project contamination (#431 — zaten fix'lendi 77c33a0)

**Kök neden (3):** `scripts/stitch-to-jsx.mjs` screen title'ını (Türkçe) `toComponentName()` ile transliterate ederek `src/screens/OyunEkrani.tsx` üretiyor. Planner ise story scope_files'a İngilizce hayali yollar koyuyor (`src/pages/GameScreen.tsx`). Developer ya Türkçe dosyayı modifiye ederek scope bleed'e düşüyor ya da İngilizce dosyayı oluşturarak routing'i kırıyor. 6 retry sonrası abandon.

**Fix (commit d714043):**
- `computePredictedScreenFiles()`: DESIGN_MANIFEST.json okur, `toComponentName` mirror'ı ile Stitch'in üreteceği tam yolları hesaplar
- Stories step context'ine `predicted_screen_files` inject edilir (planner görür)
- Post-complete guardrail: `src/pages/`, `src/views/`, `src/components/screens/` altında PREDICTED_SCREEN_FILES'ta olmayan screen-like yolları tespit eder, failStep + öneri mesajı
- Multi-owner auto-fix: her screen tam 1 story tarafından scope_files'da sahiplenilir, fazlası shared_files'a taşınır (merge conflict #428/#430'u önler)
- Planner AGENTS.md'ye Türkçe transliterasyon örnekleri ve MUTLAK kural eklendi

**Güvenlik:** Pure addition (140+, 0-). DESIGN_MANIFEST.json yoksa helper `[]` döner, guardrail no-op — backward compatible.

**Doğrulama:** Run #435 kelime-tahmin-17697 başlatıldı (çok-ekranlı test case: Ana Menü, Zorluk Seçimi, Oyun, Sonuç, Ayarlar, Bilgi). Stories step'te predicted_screen_files injection + scope_files doğrulama gözlenecek.

---

### Hotfix (2026-04-14 09:54 TR): Peek-Recovery Cross-Project Contamination

**Sorun:** Yemek-42206 (Run #431) 09:40'ta US-001 abandon limit (5/5) ile fail oldu. Log'da "CROSS-PROJECT CONTAMINATION: STORY_BRANCH 0eb0562c-us-003 does not match run prefix b1e1b32c".

**Kök neden:** `peekStep` + `claimStep` recovery blokları `/tmp/setfarm-output-*.txt` tüm dosyaları tarıyordu. Pool agent (feature-dev_developer) olarak polling yapan lux, koda'nın (artık fail olmuş renk-koru'dan kalma) stale `setfarm-output-koda.txt` dosyasını yakaladı ve yemek'in running implement step'ine auto-complete etti. Cross-project-guard yakaladı ama step 5 kez toggle olmuştu.

**Fix (commit 77c33a0):**
- `peekStep` signature'a `callerGatewayAgent?: string` eklendi
- Recovery blokları caller verildiğinde SADECE `/tmp/setfarm-output-<caller>.txt` kontrol ediyor
- CLI peek handler `--caller` flag parse ediyor
- polling-prompt.md peek komutuna `{{CALLER_FLAG}}` eklendi
- Non-pool agent'lar (planner/designer) eski davranışı korur

**Doğrulama:** `ensure-crons feature-dev` + stale tmp cleanup sonrası peek komutları artık `--caller <name>` ile çalışıyor.

---

### Hotfix (2026-04-14 08:45 TR): Claim Starvation Bug

**Sorun:** 3 paralel run implement step'te pending iken, nefes-39489 (Run #432) 28+ dakika claim edilmedi. Free developer'lar her polling'de NO_WORK aldı.

**Kök neden:** claimStep SELECT sorgusu LIMIT 1 ile tek implement step dönüyor. 3 step aynı step_index=5, hepsi pending, tiebreaker yok. Postgres rastgele satır döndü. Başka dev'e atanmış run'ın step'i geldiğinde downstream CAS fail oluyor ve caller NO_WORK dönüyor — diğer run'lara bakmadan. Assigned dev kendi run'ını bile alamıyor.

**Fix (commit f0389b0):**
- Query caller-aware: implement step'lerde diğer dev'e atanmış run'lar filtrelenir
- ORDER BY: own-run (0) > unassigned (1) > others (2)
- Non-implement step'ler etkilenmez (step_id <> implement short-circuit)

**Doğrulama:** Patch sonrası nexus ilk cron tick'te nefes'i claim etti (workflow.log 05:45:37Z).

## 2026-04-14 — Tek Developer Modeli + Pipeline Güvenilirliği

### Büyük Değişiklik: Tek Developer / Proje Modeli
Paralel story modeli yerine her projede TEK developer çalışıyor. Developer implement step'te otomatik atanır, proje bitene kadar kilitli kalır.

**Neden:** Paralel modelde integration wiring (US-004) neredeyse her run'da fail oluyordu. Scope bleed, merge conflict, gateway lane congestion sürekli sorun. Tek developer = sıfır merge conflict, sıfır scope sorunu, doğal entegrasyon.

### Teknik Değişiklikler

**Developer Reservation (9ba0e0c + 69146c8):**
- `runs.assigned_developer` kolonu
- Implement claim anında pool'dan boş developer otomatik atanır
- Atomic CAS pattern (TOCTOU race korumalı)
- Run bitince developer pool'a döner

**Stories Template Sadeleştirme (5ce5c71):**
- Zorunlu "integration story" kuralı kaldırıldı
- Single Developer Mode bölümü eklendi
- `scope_files` zorunlu değil — tek developer tüm dosyaları yazıyor
- Son story artık lightweight verification + cleanup

**Gateway Config Optimizasyonu:**
- `announceTimeoutMs`: 300s → 15s
- `subagents.maxConcurrent`: 20 → 8
- Sonuç: Lane wait 31dk → 27s (%98 azalma), gateway stall sıfır

**Polling Prompt Template (628d2a6):**
- 80 satırlık prompt → `src/installer/prompts/polling-prompt.md`
- Kod değişikliği olmadan prompt güncelleme mümkün

**Context Cache (628d2a6):**
- `getProjectTree`, `getInstalledPackages` 5 dakika cache
- Tek developer aynı workdir'da tekrar tekrar çağırıyordu

### Kritik Bug Fix'ler
- `file_skeletons` DB/context bağlanması (ff029d8) — implement step "Blocked: unresolved variable" hatası giderildi
- `buildPollingPrompt` 3. parametre eksikliği (step-fail.ts)
- `checkStuckWaitingSteps` medic'e eklendi
- 43 bare `catch {}` → `logger.debug()` — sessiz hatalar görünür oldu

### Performans
- PG connection pool: 20 → 50
- DB index: `steps(agent_id, status)` ve `runs(status, assigned_developer)`
- Kimi quota bitti → 6 developer MiniMax M2.7'ye çevrildi

### OpenClaw v2026.4.12 Denemesi Başarısız
- RAM patlaması (1.7GB/15dk, WS 1006 crash)
- Issue #65441 — tüm session geçmişini startup'ta yüklüyor
- Geri alındı → v2026.4.2 + config fix

### Doğrulama
- Run #425: `assigned_developer` otomatik `koda` atandı
- Run #428: Stories 4 → 3 (integration story kaldırıldı)
- Gateway lane wait: tek run'da sadece 1 event, 27s

## 2026-04-13 — file_skeletons + Pipeline Debug (Mac)

- `file_skeletons` özelliği — story'ler arası API kontratı
- `stitch-to-jsx` — Stitch HTML → otomatik React component
- `checkIntegrationWiring` — tüm entry dosyaları kontrol
- `dep-merge` zinciri düzeltmeleri
- Coherence check + actionable guardrails
- WORKDIR enforcement

## v0.2.2 — 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Prevented mixed timestamp formats from triggering false abandoned-step cleanups
- Guarded pipeline completion when steps or stories are failed/pending

### Added
- Per-agent timeout override for cron sessions via workflow agent `timeoutSeconds`

## v0.2.1 — 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Hardened pipeline state transitions to avoid marking runs completed on partial failure

## v0.2.0 — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Step output now reads from stdin instead of CLI arguments, fixing shell escaping issues that caused complex output (STORIES_JSON, multi-line text) to be silently dropped
- This was the root cause of loop steps (like security audit fixes) completing with zero work done

### Added
- `setfarm version` — show installed version
- `setfarm update` — pull latest, rebuild, and reinstall workflows in one command
- CHANGELOG.md

## v0.1.0 — Initial release

- Multi-agent workflow orchestration for OpenClaw
- Three bundled workflows: feature-dev, bug-fix, security-audit
- Story-based execution with per-story verification
- SQLite-backed run/step/story tracking
- Dashboard at localhost:3333
- CLI with workflow management, step operations, and log viewing
